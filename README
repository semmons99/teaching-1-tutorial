For this exercise, you'll be creating a technical tutorial of some sort. It can
be on any topic you'd like, and in any format you'd like.  The most simple thing
is a how-to article, the more ambitious could create a screencast or interactive
learning experience such as the Ruby Koans.

Pitch your idea via university-web's review system, and then once you get it
approved, fork this repository and hack away!
